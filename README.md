# moongl_test

**A learning experience for moongl**

This is built utilzing [Moonlibs](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs) https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs. Moonlibs is an awesome natively compiled api for C libraries using Lua to run the entire engine's logic.

Probably only going to run on Linux. Might pop up a Windows 10/11 script to install [Moonlibs](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs) automatically. I don't have a Mac so that one is up in the air.
